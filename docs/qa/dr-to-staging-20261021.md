# DR retirement into independent Staging — in progress

## User scope

The user authorized retiring the existing DR as Staging, and explicitly chose:
prove backup restoration first, remove only DR's old replicas, then use synthetic
test data. Preserve Primary, its business data, and other workspaces. No new paid
resources. Staging must not send real payments, LINE notifications, invoices, or
printer jobs. No data deletion is authorized by a failed backup run.

## Verified baseline and completed operations

- Primary Supabase: `eyuctbnlvnbnivwasvqr`, ACTIVE_WRITER, epoch 3.
- DR Supabase: `daeqwtpaxcebmtwxqdkj`, READ_ONLY_STANDBY, writes disabled.
- Primary Vercel: `prj_uoG4FNJIgnF1LdKRiXnfRaieXnUP`;
  `dpl_CUDFLirEEGzfc633vnBPpXNeWWKW`, source
  `b651daba7014d540d7105a642ff0d7d5f3e2ded2`, `app.qidaigo.com`.
- DR Vercel: `prj_GOSwYN5rKhSuD3d4gPJEVtmKt7b3`, still the older DR deployment;
  no domain, environment, or deployment change made in this phase.
- 2026-10-21 21:35 Asia/Taipei: real Google owner login reached admin billing and
  health. App/current DB/DR connection checks passed; stale replication evidence,
  seven unverified checks and payment maintenance were existing gaps, not passes.
- DR-only migration `20261021133744` removed the already disabled, slot-detached
  `stallorder_primary_to_dr` subscription after confirming all 124 relations
  were ready and the standby writer fence remained enabled.
- Exact inactive/lost Primary slot of the same name removed with epoch 3 and
  writer-state guards. No publication or business data removed.
- Readback: no subscription/slot, DR still has 827 orders and 42 Storage objects;
  all nine DR scheduled jobs inactive. Primary availability remains NORMAL_PRIMARY.

## Separate Storage dependency

Database detachment does not stop `/api/cron/storage-replication`.
`storage-replication-service.ts` also deletes expired files from Primary. Do not
disable the entire cron or remove credentials without preserving Primary-only
cleanup. Before DR data removal, retire Primary-to-DR file replication and remove
DR eligibility from failover/routing. Current 48 MIRRORED jobs are historical,
not proof that future mirroring is disabled.

## Backup gate (not yet passed)

The owner-only branch workflow uses existing GitHub Production secrets and the
same `production-dr-operations` concurrency group. It only reads the exact DR
session-pooler endpoint; all restore writes use a disposable runner loopback DB.
It captures public/auth/storage/app_private/internal/vault tables and actual
Storage bytes, encrypts with AES-256-GCM and the existing backup key, decrypts and
restores the data, compares every source-column table digest, verifies every file
byte digest, and fails on source drift. Artifacts must contain encrypted payloads
only, plus a non-sensitive verification receipt. An archive listing or successful
upload alone is not restore proof. Full provider/configuration/credential recovery
is not claimed by this data-restore check.

Run `39612421419` captured and encrypted 239 tables and all 42 files. Artifact
`12350673658` (9,432,858 bytes) was retained; archive SHA-256
`fda9a0020826d94c06b502b22a1573225c63b304e65efe2cdf7ca5f32715cb0d`.
The data-restore step failed with a missing database object before validation;
this is NOT a passing backup gate and permits no DR deletion. A corrected runner
schema setup is under verification.

Local regression: 26 tests across seven Storage/catalog/asset consumer files and
four encryption/target tests pass. Full unit suite: 555 files and 3,372 tests
passed, two files/nine tests skipped. Typecheck, Production build and the
335-file UI audit passed. ESLint has zero errors and five existing navigation
warnings. Dependency audit reports zero vulnerabilities. These checks do not
establish deployed Primary cleanup or Staging readiness.

## Provider access blocker and latest restore attempt

Read-only Cloudflare inventory run `39616131097` failed with HTTP 403. The local
token separately returned code 9109 (invalid access token). No DNS, Access or
Vercel environment mutation was attempted. The owner has been asked to update
the existing GitHub `production` environment `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` securely,
without posting its value or expanding its resource scope.

The older read-only operator Plan `39615795041` failed before provider access:
the workflow did not generate Prisma after install scripts were disabled. That
failure is not evidence of a Cloudflare provider read or a successful Plan.

Restore run `39615232670` captured the encrypted backup but failed with
`PSQL_FAILED_1_MUST_BE_OWNER`: provider-owned schemas cannot be replaced by the
ordinary local `postgres` role. Revision `5dc7090c` confines restore operations
to the exact disposable runner container's Unix socket and its local
`supabase_admin` role; it cannot target either hosted database. Run `39616803086`
completed with pre-data and data restoration passing, but post-data constraint
validation failed. A read-only check of every source foreign key identified
exactly one inconsistent relationship: 552 `print_jobs` reference three absent
`print_rules`. Every other checked foreign key has zero orphaned rows. A bounded
Primary read confirmed the three parent rule IDs still exist there; no parent
rows were copied, no constraints disabled, and no print jobs replayed or changed.
This source inconsistency means the full restore gate remains failed and DR
deletion remains prohibited.

The owner updated the GitHub environment secret at `2026-10-21T14:38:43Z`.
Fresh audit `39619054558` still received Cloudflare HTTP 403 / code 9109 at the
zone read (optional user-token verification returned HTTP 401 / code 1000).
Thus the updated value is not yet accepted; this is not a successful credential
repair. Chrome pages for the Cloudflare API Token manager and the exact GitHub
Production environment were opened for secure user entry. Browser page control
was unavailable; no credentials were read, entered or submitted by automation.

Pending: pass actual backup restoration; separately retire file replication;
prove effective permissions and synthetic seed isolation; convert Preview runtime,
domain and Access; real Staging user flows; final Primary identity and flow checks.
No Staging readiness or release completion is claimed.
